This r model has the purpose to verify if there is a relation between the wine quality based upon sensorial tests done by eonologists and the physicochemical properties of wine.

The data set on which the article is developed is available from UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a repository database, theories and data generators, used for the study and analysis of machine learning algorithms.

The model was developed following a scientific study developed by investigators from Universidade do Minho.

The data mining techniques that were used were the Multiple Regression (MR), Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) . While the MR is classic approach to this type of problems and models are obtained which are easier to interpret, the NN and SVM have the greatest potential to achieve better results although it requires a greater effort to achieve because there are parameters that have to be tuned correctly (in NN the number of hidden layers and in the SVM the parameter kernel) does not incur the overfit (too adjusted to the data), which leads models to lose the ability to generalize to other datasets.
